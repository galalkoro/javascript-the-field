* Open index.html in your browser. What is the difference between this and the previous example?
* 
  the previous example the script file writen on `<head>` tag and this writen on js folder apart and linked in html `<body>` tag  and text in browser still in mid of page although the text inside is'not html file but in js file 


* Do you notice a difference between the 2 document.write lines?
  
         the first placed on html head tag and second place on js file 
         and the result on prowser are the same 
         
* Look at the 'Template literals' documentation
